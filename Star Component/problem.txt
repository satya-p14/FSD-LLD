Read the entire problem description carefully to understand the necessary details.

The HTML code that is provided holds the following components and functions:
1. div#star-container => Containing 5 span.star inside it.
2. span.star => Individual star symbol with default grey color.

1.3. and remove the class of 'star-filled' from all the stars that need to be of default color. (grey)

2. Whenever any span.star is clicked on:
2.1. You need to repeat step 1 to color the stars yellow till the target span.star
2.2. Update the Rating Count (span#count) with the star points. (Ex: If third star is clicked, rating count becomes 3)
2.3. Store the value of star points globally, to update the colors when the mouse hovers over or leaves any span.star

3. Whenever mouse leaves any span.star after hover:
3.1. Remove the class of 'star-filled' from all the stars beyond the selected star points global value. (set to 0 by default)
